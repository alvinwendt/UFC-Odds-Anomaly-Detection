</div>


<h2 align="center"> This project is a final capstone for Nashville Software School (NSS) to understand UFC fight factors that could create a predictive model and detect sportbook odds anomalies related to a fight's expected outcome.

## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Is it possible to understand to create a model to predict expected outcomes of UFC fights and be able to compare those outcomes to sports bet odds in order to detect anomalies?


## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
- Create a UFC Fight Predictive Model
- Compare probabilities of expected outcomes to implied probability from odds data to detect anomalies


## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
- The quality and quantity of existing UFC and sports betting data
- Determinability of the expected outcome of fights due to high volatility
- Some features that may be impactful to the model are unmeasurable (i.e. Heart, Popularity, Unknown Injuries)

Scraped Data from various sources, including [UFCstats.com](https://www.ufcstats.com/), [Sherdog.com](https://www.sherdog.com/) and [BestFightOdds.com](https://www.bestfightodds.com/)

## üíª Model <a name = "model"></a>
### The following were the models utilized to create a predictive model:
***H2o Library***
1. Generalized Linear Regression (GLM)
2. Random Forest with Hypertuning
3. Gradiant Boosting Model (GBM)
4. Deep Learning

***Tidyverse Library***
1. Random Forest with Hypertuning
2. XGBoost with Hypertuning

### ***Below are the scoreing metrics from the models produced***

|Model        |Library Used| Accuracy |Recall| Precision | F1-Score |
| ---------- |-----------| --|-------------| ------ |-----------|
|GLM       |H2o| 0.61 |0.65| 0.75 | 0.70 |
|GBM       | H2o|0.61 |0.64| 0.77 | 0.70 |
|Random Forest  |H2o| 0.61 |0.63| 0.85 | 0.72 |
|Deep Learning |H2o| 0.55 |0.62| 0.65 | 0.63 |
|Random Forest (Hypertuned) |Tidymodels| 0.57 |0.91| 0.56 | 0.79 |
|XGBoost (Hypertuned) |Tidymodels| 0.57 |0.81| 0.56 | 0.67 |

A last approach was to perform a stacked ensemble method by combining models. This is a proven method to boost model performance.
After stacking was performed, the new model returned the folloing metrics.

|Model        |Library Used| Accuracy |Recall| Precision | F1-Score |
| ---------- |-----------| --|-------------| ------ |-----------|
|Stacked Ensemble   |H2o| 0.63 |0.66| 0.77 | 0.72 |

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
1. Besides betting on fight outcomes, there are other types of bet such as when a round will end or how the fight will end such as a decision or knockout. I would be curious to see if a better model could be created with a difference in target variable. 

2. I would love to have created a live model that predicts based on adjusting odds during a fight as odd shift as the fight unfolds. 

3. Additionally, more time dedicated to the predictive model for expected outcomes with an R Shiny App implementation would have been fun and valuable.
