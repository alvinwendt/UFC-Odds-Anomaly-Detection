## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Is it possible to understand the relationships between expected outcomes of UFC fights and their related sport bet odds and create a model to disclose anomalies between them?


## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>


## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
- The quality and quantity of existing UFC and sports betting data
- Determinability of the expected outcome of fights are highly volatile
- Sports Betting odd doesn't necessarily follow fight data but adjust to market demand
- Creation of a metric and baseline to identify anomaliess

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
I would love to have created a live model that predicts based on adjusting odds during a fight. Additionally, more time dedicated to the predictive model for expected outcomes with an R Shiny App implementation would have been fun and valuable.

## 🏁 Data Collection with Web Scraping <a name = "data"></a>
